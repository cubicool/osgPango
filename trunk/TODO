- Add GlyphCache loading from images/metadata.

- Add the ability to dump the caches in one large PNG, instead of a
  bunch of pngs. This should be a "developer debug" image.

- Add a wrapper around having to use <span> all the time; perhaps
  a kind of ostream<< clone.

- Investigate manually creating a GlyphCache using a Pango font
  description and using that in addText.
