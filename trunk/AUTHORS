osgPango is primarily by:

	Jeremy Moles (cubicool) <jeremy@emperorlinx.com>

However, significant bugfixes and additional code have been provided by:

	Cedric Pinson (mornifle) <mornifle@plopbyte.net>

...who is also the author of the fantastic Animtk/osgATK toolkit (with
which I also try and assist as often as I can... :))
