//! a small demonstration of how to use TextOSGInterface by gluing
//! the Geometry provided by our parent class with the natural positioning 
//! power of osg::MatrixTransform. It provides a small API for arranging text
//! in 3D space, though it is not at all suited for people who want a full range
//! of transformations (unless they just want to interface with osg::MatrixTransform
//! directly, which is perfectly fine).
